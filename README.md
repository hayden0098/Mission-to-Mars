# Mission-to-Mars-

## overview of the project
Write a script to gather data about the mission to Mars, a web application that scrape data information automatically. By using python script to navigate the webpages to collect the information and store into a NoSQL database, Mongo DB. Then using Flask Web Framework to create web applation using Python and customize it with HTML and CSS. 

Robin's web app is looking good and functioning well, but she wants to add more polish to it. She had been admiring images of Mars’s hemispheres online and realized that the site is scraping-friendly. She would like to adjust the current web app to include all four of the hemisphere images. To do this, you’ll use BeautifulSoup and Splinter to scrape full-resolution images of Mars’s hemispheres and the titles of those images, store the scraped data on a Mongo database, use a web application to display the data, and alter the design of the web app to accommodate these images.
